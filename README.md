# ML-Fall2023
This repository contains the projects I’ve completed for the Machine Learning course at Kharazmi University.

## ML Project
The scenario which I chose for this project is written below:
### Image Classification:
A company wants to develop an image classification model that can automatically classify images of different products based on their attributes. The model should be able to differentiate between different types of products, such as clothing, electronics, and household items. The company plans to use the model to improve its inventory management system and optimize its supply chain.

## White Paper
For this project I chose a paper titled “Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification” by Yoon Kim. It can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882

In the link below, I have provided code that implements solutions from this paper.
